## Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Identifying the causes and developing an effective predictive system for heart attacks is crucial. The provided dataset contains information on various factors that may influence heart health. This project aims to thoroughly analyze the data to provide insights that can aid in further analysis and model development.

## Approach

### 1. Preliminary Analysis

- **Data Inspection**: Conduct an initial review of the dataset to assess its structure, identify missing values, and detect duplicates.
- **Data Cleaning**: Based on the findings, remove duplicates (if any) and handle missing values using appropriate strategies.

### 2. Data Exploration and Reporting

Prepare an informative report that details the distribution of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related factors:

- **Statistical Summary**: Provide a preliminary statistical summary of the data, including measures of central tendency and data spread.
- **Categorical Variables**: Identify and explore categorical variables using appropriate visualization tools such as count plots.
- **CVD Occurrence by Age**: Analyze the occurrence of CVD across different age groups.
- **Gender Composition**: Study the composition of the patient population with respect to gender.
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Investigate whether heart attacks can be detected based on anomalies in resting blood pressure.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack.
- **Peak Exercise and Heart Attack**: Explore the relationship between peak exercise levels and the occurrence of heart attacks.
- **Thalassemia and CVD**: Assess whether thalassemia is a major cause of cardiovascular disease.
- **Other Factors**: Examine how other factors in the dataset contribute to the occurrence of CVD.
- **Pair Plot Analysis**: Use a pair plot to understand the relationships between all the given variables.

### 3. Model Development

- **Baseline Model**: Build a baseline predictive model using Logistic Regression. Explore and evaluate the results to understand the modelâ€™s effectiveness in predicting heart attacks.
